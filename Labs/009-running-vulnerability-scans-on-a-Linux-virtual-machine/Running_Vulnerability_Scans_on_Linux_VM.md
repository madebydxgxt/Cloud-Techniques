## Steps Performed

## Running Vulnerability Scans on a Linux Virtual Machine

 

**1. Introduction** [0:00](https://loom.com/share/f18e7e55d86b4aedacc9df86c9a164e2?t=0)
![image alt](

- Welcome to the tutorial on running vulnerability scans on a virtual machine.
- Previous example was on Windows; this time we will focus on a Linux system.

 

**2. Create a Virtual Machine** [0:11](https://loom.com/share/f18e7e55d86b4aedacc9df86c9a164e2?t=11)


- Start by creating a new virtual machine for the Linux scan.
- Click on 'Virtual Machine' to begin the setup.

 

**3. Configure Subscription and Resource Group** [0:37](https://loom.com/share/f18e7e55d86b4aedacc9df86c9a164e2?t=37)


- Select your subscription level (billing structure).
- Choose a resource group for managing resources (like a file system).
- For this example, select 'students' as the resource group.

 

**4. Set Up Virtual Machine Details** [0:56](https://loom.com/share/f18e7e55d86b4aedacc9df86c9a164e2?t=56)


- Name the virtual machine (e.g., 'VS scan.win').
- Choose the region (e.g., East Coast).
- Select Ubuntu Server 24 as the operating system.

 

**5. Configure Disk and Network Settings** [1:10](https://loom.com/share/f18e7e55d86b4aedacc9df86c9a164e2?t=70)


- Keep the default disk size but change to standard SSD for cost efficiency.
- Select the virtual network and subnet (e.g., Cyberrange VNet and Cyberrange subnet).

 

**6. Choose Scan Type** [1:48](https://loom.com/share/f18e7e55d86b4aedacc9df86c9a164e2?t=108)


- Plan to run both unauthorized and authorized scans.
- For the unauthorized scan, select 'no IP' to avoid setting up a network interface controller.

 

**7. Create the Virtual Machine** [2:42](https://loom.com/share/f18e7e55d86b4aedacc9df86c9a164e2?t=162)


- Validate the settings and create the virtual machine.

 

**8. Set Up Vulnerability Scanning Tool** [2:47](https://loom.com/share/f18e7e55d86b4aedacc9df86c9a164e2?t=167)


- Use Tenable for vulnerability scanning.
- Ensure you have an account with Tenable.

 

**9. Create a New Scan** [2:59](https://loom.com/share/f18e7e55d86b4aedacc9df86c9a164e2?t=179)


- Navigate to 'Vulnerability Management' and click 'Scans'.
- Create a new scan (Basic Network Scan) and name it (e.g., 'vScanLin').
- Use the internal scanner for the scan.

 

**10. Obtain IP Address** [3:46](https://loom.com/share/f18e7e55d86b4aedacc9df86c9a164e2?t=226)


- Retrieve the private IP address from the virtual machine.
- Input the IP address into the vulnerability scan software.

 

**11. Configure Scan Settings** [4:05](https://loom.com/share/f18e7e55d86b4aedacc9df86c9a164e2?t=245)


- Set discovery options (e.g., ping the remote host).
- Save and launch the scan.

 

**12. Understand Scan Types** [4:38](https://loom.com/share/f18e7e55d86b4aedacc9df86c9a164e2?t=278)


- Note the difference between unauthorized and authorized scans.
- Unauthorized scans do not use login credentials.

 

**13. Log into the Linux Virtual Machine** [5:50](https://loom.com/share/f18e7e55d86b4aedacc9df86c9a164e2?t=350)


- Connect to the virtual machine using Bastion.
- Enter your username and password to log in.

 

**14. Access Root User** [7:12](https://loom.com/share/f18e7e55d86b4aedacc9df86c9a164e2?t=432)


- Use commands to log in as a root user.

 

**15. Run the Vulnerability Scan** [8:08](https://loom.com/share/f18e7e55d86b4aedacc9df86c9a164e2?t=488)


- Ensure the scan is running with the correct IP address.
- Wait for the scan to complete.

 

**16. Review Scan Results** [8:41](https://loom.com/share/f18e7e55d86b4aedacc9df86c9a164e2?t=521)


- After the scan, review the report generated by Tenable.
- Identify vulnerabilities and consider ways to address them.

 

**17. Conclusion** [8:51](https://loom.com/share/f18e7e55d86b4aedacc9df86c9a164e2?t=531)


- Thank you for participating in the tutorial.
