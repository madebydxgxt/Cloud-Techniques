## Objective
Deploy a Linux virtual machine in Azure and perform an unauthorized vulnerability scan using Tenable to analyze exposed services and security posture.

---

## Skills Practiced
- Creating and configuring Azure Virtual Machines  
- Managing resource groups and subscriptions  
- Configuring virtual networks and subnets  
- Selecting disk types and cost optimization options  
- Running vulnerability scans with Tenable  
- Performing unauthorized (credential-less) scans  
- Connecting securely to a VM using Azure Bastion  
- Interpreting vulnerability scan results  

---

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Azure Portal  
- Azure Virtual Machine (Ubuntu Server)  
- Azure Virtual Network (VNet) and Subnet  
- Azure Bastion  
- Tenable Vulnerability Management  
- Tenable Scan Engine (Internal Scanner)

## Steps Performed

1. **Created Linux Virtual Machine**  
   Deployed a new Ubuntu Server virtual machine in Azure using default configuration and a selected region.

3. **Configured Network Settings**  
   Assigned the VM to an existing virtual network and subnet while limiting external exposure.

4. **Validated and Deployed VM**  
   Reviewed configuration settings, passed validation checks, and completed the VM deployment.

5. **Accessed Tenable Vulnerability Management**  
   Logged into Tenable and navigated to the Vulnerability Management and Scans section.

6. **Created Basic Network Scan**  
   Configured a new basic network scan using the internal scan engine.

7. **Captured Private IP Address**  
   Retrieved the VM’s private IP address from Azure to define the scan target.

8. **Configured Unauthorized Scan Settings**  
   Set up the scan without credentials to simulate an external attacker performing reconnaissance.  
   (Optional screenshot) docs/step-8.png

9. **Launched Vulnerability Scan**  
   Saved and launched the scan to analyze exposed services and potential vulnerabilities.  
   (Optional screenshot) docs/step-9.png

10. **Connected via Azure Bastion**  
    Established a secure connection to the Linux VM using Azure Bastion without exposing a public IP.  
    (Optional screenshot) docs/step-10.png

11. **Authenticated into Linux VM**  
    Logged into the VM using the configured username and password credentials.  
    (Optional screenshot) docs/step-11.png

12. **Reviewed Scan Results**  
    Examined vulnerability findings within Tenable and compared unauthorized scan behavior to previous test scenarios.

## Outcome
Successfully deployed a Linux virtual machine in Azure and conducted an unauthorized vulnerability scan using Tenable to evaluate its security exposure.
